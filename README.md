## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- - [Tailwind CSS Framework](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was a little bit hard at first to do Mobile-first workflow but as soon as I started coding I notice the difference, It's much easier and structure to do Mobile-first workflow. Also this is my first time combinig tailwind with JavaScript, so I am still learning the workflow to work with Tailwind and JavaScript DOM manipulation seemlessly

### Continued development

I am going to work with TailwindCSS to learn the best approach and practice to work with the DOM.
